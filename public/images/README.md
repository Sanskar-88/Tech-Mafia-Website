# Image-Free Design

This website has been designed to work without requiring any actual images. Instead, we use:

## Alternative Approaches Used

1. **Emojis**: We use emojis as visual elements to represent different categories and content types
   - 📱 for mobile phones
   - 💻 for laptops
   - ⌚ for wearables
   - 🎮 for gadgets
   - 🏠 for smart home devices
   - 🤖 for AI-related content

2. **Colored Backgrounds**: Each category has its own color scheme
   - Blue for mobile phones
   - Gray for laptops
   - Purple for wearables
   - Green for gadgets

3. **Gradients**: Used for hero sections and category cards to create visual interest

4. **Typography**: Strong typography to convey information hierarchy

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Faster Loading**: No need to wait for image downloads
- **Better Accessibility**: Screen readers can interpret emojis and text
- **Easier Maintenance**: No need to manage image assets
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Saves data for users on limited connections
- **Consistent Styling**: Easier to maintain a consistent look and feel

## If You Want to Add Images Later

If you decide to add actual images later, you can:

1. Create the following directories:
   - `/public/images/`
   - `/public/images/categories/`
   - `/public/images/articles/`

2. Add images with descriptive filenames

3. Modify the components to use the Next.js Image component instead of the current placeholders
